== Description ==
= Logo or Image Replace =

Logo or Image Replace is a simple Wordpress plugin to replace logo or any image on per page basis. Useful to choose a new company logo per page.

This plugin works with WordPress pages. Go to edit any page to see the option at the bottom.

It allows you to replace a single image per page with a new one of your choosing. Sample usecase is if you need to use different Logo image on different pages. Normally this is not possible but now you can just define an alternative image for your logo. 

Not only logo - this plugin basically allows you to define an alternative image to display for any image. Just paste the file name to replace and upload or select the alternative image that you want to show.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin replace only logo? =
No. You can replace any image

= Can I upload images with any proportion or size =
It is best if you select an alternative image that is the exact same width and height as the original one. But the plugin allows you to define HTML width and Height. So that would help to maintain the proportion.
